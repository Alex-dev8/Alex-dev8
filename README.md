Hi! My name is Alex and I'm a mobile and Mac OS software engineer.
For the past 5 years I've developed and deployed over 10 apps to the AppStore and PlayStore using Swift and React Native.
Here on GitHub I upload only a few personal projects to showcase specific technologies and frameworks, since all client work is private and the code belongs to them.
When it comes to design patterns, my choice always falls onto MVVM which lends itself perfectly to Swift, whether I'm using SwiftUI or UIKit.
Nowadays I mostly use Swift concurrency for networking, but have extensive experience also using Combine.
