- 👋 Hi, I’m Alex! I'm an iOS developer with a background in JavaScript, and now fully converted to Swift.
- 👀 I’m interested in practicing my skills and working in small teams on exciting projects!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Swift and SwiftUI - as I'm still quite new to coding I constantly working on something new every day.
- 🌏 I've been travelling around the world for the past 5 years, living the digital nomad life. Most of my time has been spent in Seoul, South Korea.
- 📫 You can find me on Twitter @Alex_dev8
