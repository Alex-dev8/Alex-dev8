Hi! My name is Alex and I'm a senior mobile engineer.
For the past 8 years I've developed and deployed tens of apps to the AppStore and PlayStore using Swift and React Native.
Here on GitHub I upload only a few personal projects to showcase specific technologies and frameworks, since all client work is private.

Alex-dev8/Alex-dev8 is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
